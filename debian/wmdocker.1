.SH NAME
wmdocker \- System tray for KDE3/GNOME2 docklet applications 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wmdocker
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B wmdocker
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBwmdocker\fP is a docking application (WindowMaker dock app) which acts as a system tray for KDE3 and GNOME2. It can be used to replace the panel in either
environment, allowing you to have a system tray without running the KDE/GNOME
panel.
.PP
Docker was written and designed to work with Openbox 2, but it should work
fine in any window manager that supports WindowMaker dock apps.
